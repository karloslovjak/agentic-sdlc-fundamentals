## 2025-10-18T11:49 – Update Spring Boot Version and Convert to YAML

**Request (paraphrased):** Upgrade Spring Boot from 3.3.4 to 3.5.6 and convert application configuration from .properties to YAML format.

**Context/goal:** Use the latest stable Spring Boot version (3.5.6) and adopt YAML format for configuration, which is more readable and commonly preferred for Spring Boot applications.

**Plan:**
1. Update `pom.xml` to use Spring Boot 3.5.6
2. Convert `application.properties` to `application.yml`
3. Convert `application-test.properties` to `application-test.yml`
4. Delete old .properties files
5. Run tests to verify everything works with the new version and configuration format

**Changes:**
- Updated `backend/pom.xml`:
  - Changed Spring Boot version from 3.3.4 to 3.5.6
- Created `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml`:
  - Converted all properties to YAML format
  - Maintained all configuration: server, datasource (H2 + PostgreSQL ready), JPA/Hibernate, logging, Jackson
  - Improved readability with YAML structure and comments
- Created `backend/src/test/resources/application-test.yml`:
  - Converted test configuration to YAML format
  - Maintained H2 test database settings, reduced logging, banner disabled
- Deleted old configuration files:
  - `application.properties`
  - `application-test.properties`

**Result:**
- Build successful with Spring Boot 3.5.6
- All tests pass: 3 tests (2 CorsConfig tests, 1 application context test)
- YAML configuration loaded correctly
- 100% coverage maintained
- No functionality changes, pure technical update

```
[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

**Next steps:**
- Implement Task entity and business logic
- Initialize frontend React project

## 2025-10-18T11:47 – Backend Project Scaffold

**Request (paraphrased):** Create Spring Boot backend project structure with all necessary configuration, but without implementing Task functionality yet. Add reference to copilot-instructions.md in README.

**Context/goal:** Establish the complete backend foundation with proper layered architecture, testing infrastructure, and configuration files. Ensure 100% test coverage from the start and set up JaCoCo for coverage reporting.

**Plan:**
1. Update README.md to reference `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. Create `backend/pom.xml` with Spring Boot 3.3.4, Java 21, and all dependencies
3. Create main application class with documentation
4. Set up layered package structure (controller, service, repository, model, dto, config)
5. Create CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication
6. Configure application properties (H2 in-memory DB, PostgreSQL ready, logging)
7. Create test configuration and initial tests
8. Add package-info files documenting each layer's purpose
9. Verify build and test execution with coverage

**Changes:**
- Updated `README.md`:
  - Added note about `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for AI-assisted development context
- Created `backend/pom.xml`:
  - Spring Boot 3.3.4 parent with Java 21
  - Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Validation, PostgreSQL, H2, Lombok, DevTools
  - JaCoCo plugin configured (100% coverage check commented out until business logic exists)
  - Maven Compiler and Surefire plugins configured
- Created `backend/src/main/java/com/accenture/taskmanager/`:
  - `TaskManagerApplication.java`: Main Spring Boot application class
  - `config/CorsConfig.java`: CORS configuration allowing frontend communication
  - Package-info files for `controller/`, `service/`, `repository/`, `model/`, `dto/` with architectural documentation
- Created `backend/src/main/resources/`:
  - `application.properties`: H2 in-memory DB (dev), PostgreSQL config ready, structured logging, JSON configuration
  - `application-test.properties`: Test-specific H2 configuration, reduced logging
- Created `backend/src/test/java/com/accenture/taskmanager/`:
  - `TaskManagerApplicationTests.java`: Application context smoke test
  - `config/CorsConfigTest.java`: CORS configuration bean tests
- Created `backend/.gitignore`: Standard Spring Boot project ignore patterns

**Result:**
- Build successful: `mvn clean test` passes
- All tests pass: 3 tests (2 CorsConfig tests, 1 application context test)
- Coverage report generated: `target/site/jacoco/index.html`
- 100% coverage on existing code (2 classes analyzed)
- Project structure follows layered architecture pattern
- Ready for Task entity and business logic implementation

```
[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
Coverage report available at: target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

**Next steps:**
- Implement Task entity with validation annotations
- Create TaskRepository interface
- Implement TaskService with business logic
- Create TaskController with REST endpoints
- Add comprehensive tests for each layer (maintaining 100% coverage)
- Initialize frontend React project

## 2025-10-18T00:00 – Initial Project Documentation

**Request (paraphrased):** Create comprehensive README.md for the Task Manager project with technology stack, setup instructions, and project structure. Include certification context and specific version requirements (Java 21, Node 22).

**Context/goal:** Establish foundational project documentation to guide development and communicate the project's purpose as part of Accenture's "Agentic SDLC Fundamentals" certification using GitHub Copilot in Agent Mode with Claude Sonnet 4.5.

**Plan:**
1. Create detailed README.md with project overview
2. Document full technology stack (React + TypeScript + Vite frontend, Spring Boot + Java 21 backend)
3. Include project structure showing feature-based frontend and layered backend architecture
4. Add setup instructions for both frontend and backend
5. Document testing approach with 100% coverage requirement
6. Add certification context and AI tooling information
7. Create logbook.md to track development progress

**Changes:**
- Created/updated `README.md` with:
  - Certification banner (Accenture's "Agentic SDLC Fundamentals")
  - GitHub Copilot Agent Mode + Claude Sonnet 4.5 mention
  - Project overview and Task entity structure
  - Complete technology stack details
  - Project directory structure
  - Prerequisites (Node 22+, Java 21, Maven 3.8+, PostgreSQL 14+)
  - Setup instructions for backend and frontend
  - Testing guidelines with coverage requirements
  - API documentation placeholders
  - Code quality standards
- Created `logbook.md` with template and first entry

**Result:**
- README.md now serves as comprehensive project documentation
- Clear technology requirements established (Java 21, Node 22)
- Development standards documented (100% test coverage, structured logging, clean code)
- Project structure aligns with best practices (feature-based frontend, layered backend)

**Next steps:**
- Initialize backend Spring Boot project with Maven
- Initialize frontend React + TypeScript + Vite project
- Set up project structure and dependencies
- Implement Task entity and basic CRUD operations
