## 2025-10-18T00:00 â€“ Initial Project Documentation

**Request (paraphrased):** Create comprehensive README.md for the Task Manager project with technology stack, setup instructions, and project structure. Include certification context and specific version requirements (Java 21, Node 22).

**Context/goal:** Establish foundational project documentation to guide development and communicate the project's purpose as part of Accenture's "Agentic SDLC Fundamentals" certification using GitHub Copilot in Agent Mode with Claude Sonnet 4.5.

**Plan:**
1. Create detailed README.md with project overview
2. Document full technology stack (React + TypeScript + Vite frontend, Spring Boot + Java 21 backend)
3. Include project structure showing feature-based frontend and layered backend architecture
4. Add setup instructions for both frontend and backend
5. Document testing approach with 100% coverage requirement
6. Add certification context and AI tooling information
7. Create logbook.md to track development progress

**Changes:**
- Created/updated `README.md` with:
  - Certification banner (Accenture's "Agentic SDLC Fundamentals")
  - GitHub Copilot Agent Mode + Claude Sonnet 4.5 mention
  - Project overview and Task entity structure
  - Complete technology stack details
  - Project directory structure
  - Prerequisites (Node 22+, Java 21, Maven 3.8+, PostgreSQL 14+)
  - Setup instructions for backend and frontend
  - Testing guidelines with coverage requirements
  - API documentation placeholders
  - Code quality standards
- Created `logbook.md` with template and first entry

**Result:**
- README.md now serves as comprehensive project documentation
- Clear technology requirements established (Java 21, Node 22)
- Development standards documented (100% test coverage, structured logging, clean code)
- Project structure aligns with best practices (feature-based frontend, layered backend)

**Next steps:**
- Initialize backend Spring Boot project with Maven
- Initialize frontend React + TypeScript + Vite project
- Set up project structure and dependencies
- Implement Task entity and basic CRUD operations
