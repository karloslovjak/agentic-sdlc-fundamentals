# 🚀 CI/CD Setup Complete - Next Steps

## ✅ What's Been Configured

Your Task Manager application now has a complete CI/CD pipeline:

### 1. GitHub Actions (Continuous Integration)
- **File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Triggers:** Every push to `main` or `develop`, and PRs to `main`
- **Actions:**
  - Builds code with Maven
  - Runs all 63 tests
  - Verifies 100% code coverage
  - Packages JAR file
  - Uploads test results and coverage reports

### 2. Docker Configuration (Containerization)
- **File:** `backend/Dockerfile`
- **Type:** Multi-stage build
- **Features:**
  - Stage 1: Maven build
  - Stage 2: Lightweight JRE runtime
  - Non-root user (security)
  - Health checks enabled
  - Prod profile activated

### 3. Render.com Configuration (Deployment)
- **File:** `render.yaml`
- **Resources:**
  - PostgreSQL database (free tier)
  - Web service (Docker-based)
  - Auto-deploy on push
  - Environment variables auto-configured

### 4. Application Updates
- **Added:** Spring Boot Actuator for health checks
- **Updated:** Database configuration for environment variables
- **Updated:** Production profile for Render deployment

## 🎯 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and Render.com"
git push origin main
```

**What happens:**
- GitHub Actions runs automatically
- Builds and tests your code
- If tests pass, you're ready for Render

### Step 2: Setup Render.com (One-Time)

1. **Go to** https://render.com

2. **Sign up** with your GitHub account (free)

3. **Create Blueprint:**
   - Click "New +" → "Blueprint"
   - Select your repository: `karloslovjak/agentic-sdlc-fundamentals`
   - Render detects `render.yaml` automatically
   - Click "Apply"

4. **Wait for deployment** (~5-10 minutes first time):
   - PostgreSQL database created
   - Docker image built
   - Flyway migrations run
   - Health checks pass
   - Service goes live

5. **Get your URL:**
   - Render provides: `https://taskmanager-db-XXXX.onrender.com`
   - Save this URL!

### Step 3: Test Your Deployment

```bash
# Replace with your actual Render URL
RENDER_URL="https://taskmanager-db-XXXX.onrender.com"

# Test health check
curl $RENDER_URL/actuator/health

# Test API
curl $RENDER_URL/api/tasks

# Open Swagger UI in browser
open $RENDER_URL/swagger-ui.html
```

## 🔄 Ongoing Workflow

After initial setup, your workflow is simple:

```bash
# Make changes to code
# Run tests locally
mvn test

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Your change description"
git push

# That's it! 🎉
# - GitHub Actions runs tests
# - If tests pass, Render auto-deploys
# - New version live in ~3-5 minutes
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### GitHub Actions
- Check: https://github.com/karloslovjak/agentic-sdlc-fundamentals/actions
- See: Build status, test results, coverage reports

### Render Dashboard
- Check: https://dashboard.render.com
- See: Deployment logs, health status, metrics

### Application Health
```bash
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/actuator/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "db": { "status": "UP" },
    "diskSpace": { "status": "UP" },
    "ping": { "status": "UP" }
  }
}
```

## 💰 Cost

**Totally Free:**
- ✅ GitHub Actions: 2,000 minutes/month (unlimited for public repos)
- ✅ Render Web Service: 750 hours/month free
- ✅ Render PostgreSQL: Free tier (90 days, renewable)
- ✅ **Total: $0/month**

**Note:** Render free tier has some limitations:
- Spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after spin-down takes ~30 seconds
- Database expires after 90 days (but can recreate with Flyway migrations)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build fails in GitHub Actions
- Check: Actions tab for error logs
- Fix: Run `mvn test` locally to reproduce
- Ensure: All tests pass locally before pushing

### Render deployment fails
- Check: Render dashboard logs
- Common issues:
  - Environment variables not set (should be automatic from `render.yaml`)
  - Database not ready (wait a few minutes)
  - Health check timeout (check `/actuator/health` endpoint)

### Database connection errors
- Render automatically sets:
  - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`
  - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`
  - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`
- If issues, check Render dashboard → Database → Connection Details

### App is slow on first request
- Normal! Free tier spins down after 15 min inactivity
- First request wakes it up (~30 seconds)
- Subsequent requests are fast
